## Version 0.0.0

### Features
For the first version of the app, we have implemented the "Cat-alog" feature. Users can take photos of cats they encounter, and these photos are then uploaded to Firebase storage and displayed in a catalog showing all previously sighted cats. We have chosen this feature to showcase our database implementation and how it works with the primary use case for our app -- cataloging cat sightings.

- **Camera Screen**: Users can capture photos of cats directly within the app.
- **Firebase Storage Integration**: Photos taken in the app are uploaded to Firebase Storage.
- **Cat-alog Screen**: Displays photos of all uploaded cat sightings in a scrolling catalog
- **UI Framework**: Login screen and navbar including the map, announcements, camera, chat, and catalog

### Bug Fixes
- N/A

### Known Issues
- The app currently does not support uploading existing photos. Photos can only be uploaded through using the in-app camera screen.
- There is no way to delete or edit photos. After taking, they are immediately uploaded to firebase and displayed in the catalog.

# Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native (for cross-platform support on iOS and Android)
- **Backend**: NodeJS (for scalable server-side logic)
- **Database**: Firebase (for simple and secure storage of photos and data)
- **Additional Services**: Google Maps API (planned for future releases for map-based cat sightings)
