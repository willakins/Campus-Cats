## Bug Fixes

- **Android Login Accessibility:** Ensured the login button remains accessible on Android devices, even when the keyboard is active.
- **Android Date Picker Display:** Resolved display issues with the date picker on Android devices.
- **Report Button Alignment:** Corrected the alignment of the report button across all devices.
- **Photo Permissions Issue:** Occurred when the user tries to select a photo for the report. Previously, this caused the selection to fail silently.
- **Disable back navigation from the home screen:** Previously, this allowed android and web users to return to the login screen without logging out.
- **Show status bar on Android:** Due to rendering differences between platforms, different stylings are required.
- **Duplicate Entry Creation:** Addressed a bug that caused duplicate entries in the Cat-alog for some uploads.
- **Unclickable Buttons:** Resolved an issue where the button was only clickable on the text, making the entire button area clickable.

## Known Issues

- **GT-SSO Errors on first try:** Likely due to browser issues, a user's first attempt to create an account using GT-SSO will cause an error message. However, when retrying the user will succesfully log in to their new account.
- **User Blocking:** After the integration of GT-SSO, the block user functionality no longer works as intended, allowing blocked users to log in still.
- **Styling Issues for Wider Devices:** Because styling is based on screen dimensions, devices with more square shapes like iPads have less than ideal screen styling compared to devices with more rectangular shapes like iPhones.
- **Lack of Flexibility:** Though an extensive amount of options are given to all "create screens" like creating a catalog entry, there is no way to add another input if the club decides they want to track a new detail about a cat, station, etc.
- **Homepage Map Optimization:** The homepage map currently makes more database queries than necessary; however, performance is not noticeably impacted.
