Editing the firebase rules from here is incredibly easy.

1.) Find the file firestore.rules in JIC-4331-SCRAPCATS

(doesn't work for regular storage yet I'll do that soon sorry)

2.) Edit the rules as needed

3.) Make sure you have run npm install

4.) run "firebase deploy --only firestore"

And that should be it I believe, at least it works like that on my machine
